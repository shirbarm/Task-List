# Task-List
Android Application

The app I built is a to-do list.
When you run the app, a blank window opens with no tasks at all.
At the top right there is a three-point icon, when you click on it you get 4 options:
- Add a new task.
- Search task by date.
- Search for completed tasks.
- Search for tasks to be performed.
Each new task is added to the main window.
